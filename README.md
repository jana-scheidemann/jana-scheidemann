# 👋🏻 Welcome to my profile!

My name is Jana and I am a web developer in progress 💾 👩🏻‍💻

In my pre-IT life I worked in different fields, for example in HR, I also sold ice-cream in Spain, helped people as a Life Coach, organized diversity workshops for young adults because [diversity matters](https://www.brownsbfs.co.uk/Content/Storefront/assets/images/Diversity-Matters/Diversity-Matters-Banner.png) and much more.

I am also passionate about:
- travelling 🌎 because the world has a lot of beautiful & interesting places and a change of perspective is always good,
- food 🥗 why eat anything when you can eat something delicious,
- music 🎶 because it makes everything better.
