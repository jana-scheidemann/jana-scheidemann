# 👋🏻 Welcome to my profile!

I am a web dev newbie 👩🏻‍💻 but the passion for coding kicked in fast 😍
From January to April 2024 I attended a web dev bootcamp at [neuefische](https://github.com/neuefische) where I learned a lot in a very short time.
But now I am hooked! REACT-style 😉

In my pre-IT life I worked in a variety of fields, e.g.: 
- as HR Manager for a train company, where together with 1 HR-colleague I hired 350+ people in 1 year to guarantee the successful start of that company
- I organized and moderated diversity workshops and perspective change training for young adults to strengthen their social skills
- as a Life Coach
- I also sold ice-cream in Spain and Laos 🍦

I am also passionate about:
- travelling 🌎 because the world has a lot of beautiful & interesting places and a change of perspective is always good,
- food 🥗 why eat anything when you can eat something delicious,
- music 🎶 because it makes everything better.
