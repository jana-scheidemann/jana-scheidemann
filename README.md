# 👋🏻 Welcome to my profile!

I am a web dev newbie 👩🏻‍💻 but the passion for coding kicked in fast 😍
From january to april 2024 I attended a web dev bootcamp at [neuefische](https://github.com/neuefische) where I learned a lot in a very short time.
But now I am hooked! REACT-style 😉

In my pre-IT life I worked in a variety of fields: 
- in HR for a train company
- I organized diversity workshops for young adults
- as a Life Coach
- I also sold ice-cream in Spain
... to mention a few.

I am also passionate about:
- travelling 🌎 because the world has a lot of beautiful & interesting places and a change of perspective is always good,
- food 🥗 why eat anything when you can eat something delicious,
- music 🎶 because it makes everything better.
